## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Start the Application

The server is already running on port 3000. If you need to restart:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### Step 2: Test RBAC Permissions

#### As a Manager (e.g., Sachin or mike_manager):

1. **Login** with a manager account
2. **Navigate to TeamDashboard** (`/team`)
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Can see all 4 teams in the dropdown
   - ✅ Can filter by any team
   - ✅ Sees "All Teams" option
   - ✅ Can see "Manage Assignments" button on user cards
   - ✅ Can assign users to different teams
   - ✅ Sees all 10 users when "All Teams" is selected

**Test Actions**:
```
1. Select "All Teams" from dropdown
   → Should show all 10 users
   
2. Select "Team Alpha - Frontend"
   → Should show only testuser, demouser, Sachin
   
3. Click "Manage Assignments" on any user card
   → Modal should open with all teams listed
   
4. Assign a user to a different team
   → Assignment should save and user should move to new team
   
5. Check statistics cards
   → Should show accurate counts for selected team
   
6. Check leaderboard
   → Should show top 5 performers across all teams
```

#### As a Team Lead (e.g., teamlead1 or john_teamlead):

1. **Login** with a team lead account
2. **Navigate to TeamDashboard**
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Can only see their own team in dropdown
   - ✅ No "All Teams" option
   - ✅ Cannot see "Manage Assignments" buttons
   - ✅ Can only see their team members
   - ✅ Can view team statistics

**Test Actions**:
```
1. Check team dropdown
   → Should only show their assigned team
   
2. Verify user visibility
   → Should only see team members
   
3. Check for assignment buttons
   → Should NOT see "Manage Assignments" buttons
   
4. Check statistics
   → Should show stats only for their team
```

#### As an Employee (e.g., testuser, demouser):

1. **Login** with an employee account
2. **Navigate to TeamDashboard**
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Can only see their own team
   - ✅ No team filter dropdown (or shows only their team)
   - ✅ Cannot manage assignments
   - ✅ Can only see their team members

**Test Actions**:
```
1. Verify restricted access
   → Should only see own team and team members
   
2. Check permissions
   → No assignment or management capabilities
```

### Step 3: Test Dashboard Features

#### Statistics Cards
Test that the cards show accurate data:

```
✅ Total Members - Counts all team members
✅ Total Tasks - Counts all tasks assigned to team
✅ Completed Tasks - Counts tasks with 'completed' status
✅ Completion Rate - Shows percentage (completed/total * 100)
```

#### Leaderboard
Test the performance ranking:

```
✅ Shows top 5 performers
✅ Sorted by completion percentage
✅ Shows rank badges (🥇 🥈 🥉)
✅ Displays username and completion stats
✅ Shows completion percentage
```

#### User Cards
Test individual user displays:

```
✅ Shows user avatar/icon
✅ Displays username and email
✅ Shows role with color coding:
   - Developer/User: Blue
   - Manager: Green
   - Security: Red
✅ Shows circular progress bar with color:
   - Green: >80% completion
   - Yellow: 50-80% completion
   - Red: <50% completion
✅ Shows task stats (X of Y tasks completed)
✅ Hover displays detailed UserDetailsCard
```

#### Search Functionality
Test the search feature:

```
✅ Search by username
✅ Search by email
✅ Search by role
✅ Case-insensitive search
✅ Real-time filtering
```

#### Team Assignment Modal (Managers Only)
Test the assignment feature:

```
✅ Click "Manage Assignments" on user card
✅ Modal opens with team list
✅ Select a team
✅ Assignment saves to database
✅ User's teamId updates
✅ Team's members array updates
✅ Dashboard refreshes with new data
✅ Modal closes
```

### Step 4: Verify API Endpoints

Test that all endpoints are working:

```bash
# Get all teams (as manager)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/teams

# Get all projects (as manager)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/projects

# Get all users (filtered by role)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/users

# Get all tasks
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/tasks

# Assign user to team (managers only)
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "USER_ID"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/teams/TEAM_ID/assign
```

### Step 5: Test Edge Cases

#### Empty States
```
✅ No tasks assigned - Shows 0% completion
✅ No team members - Shows "No users found"
✅ Search returns no results - Shows empty state
```

#### Error Handling
```
✅ Network error - Shows error message with retry
✅ Unauthorized access - Redirects or shows error
✅ Invalid team assignment - Shows error toast
```

#### Performance
```
✅ Large user list - Loads smoothly
✅ Multiple simultaneous API calls - Handled correctly
✅ Rapid team switching - No lag or errors
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Non-Critical
1. **Mongoose Index Warning**: Duplicate schema index on `{"name":1}` - doesn't affect functionality
2. **API Response Times**: Initial requests may be slow (3-5 seconds) due to MongoDB Atlas cold start

### To Be Implemented (Optional)
1. **Real-time WebSocket updates** - Tasks update live when status changes
2. **Pagination** - For large user lists
3. **Caching** - To improve performance
4. **Drag-and-drop assignment** - More intuitive team assignment

## 📊 Expected Results Summary

### Manager View
- ✅ See all 4 teams
- ✅ Can filter by team or "All Teams"

- ✅ See only their team
- ✅ See only team members (3 users)
- ✅ See team statistics
- ✅ Cannot assign users

- Completion rate history

## 📝 Re-running the Seed Script

If you need to reset the data:

```bash
cd server
node src/seedTeamsAndProjects.js
```

This will:
1. Clear all existing teams and projects
2. Create 4 new teams
3. Create 4 new projects
4. Create ~50 tasks
5. Assign users to teams and projects
